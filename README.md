# State space model for estimating mosquito populations


`Model.stan` provides the model used for the paper: *A Novel Bayesian State-Space Model for Estimating Mosquito Populations*. **Authors:** Lachlan Griffin, Daniel Pagendam, Christopher Drovandi, Brendan Trewin & Nigel Beebe. This paper applied a state-space model to a novel mosquito population supression technique in Innisfail, North Queensland, Australia. For more information about the experiment see the (Dedug Innisfail website)[https://research.csiro.au/mozzieproject/].

The `slurm` scripts are for use on CSIRO HPC clusters, but also show the random seed applied -- and the hyper-parameter Stan, and Cmd Stan use.
